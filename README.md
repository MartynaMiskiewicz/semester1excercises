## Programming and Scripting

This repository contains 6 exercises and additional homework done.
Main source for studying was [python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) alongside other research. 
All the excercises are in the Branch Master. However the data folder and exercise 5 om opening the file is in Patch-1 and exercise 6 on functions is in Patch-2. Afer realizing the setup I have moved eveyrthing to master branch and all the exercies should be visible there too.
